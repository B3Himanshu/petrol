# Security Checklist for Git Upload

## ✅ Security Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Exposed Credentials
- ✅ Removed actual database password from `backend/ENV_SETUP.md`
- ✅ Removed actual database IP address from `backend/ENV_SETUP.md`
- ✅ Removed actual database name from `backend/ENV_SETUP.md`
- ✅ Replaced with placeholder values (YOUR_USERNAME, YOUR_PASSWORD, etc.)

### 2. Updated Database Configuration
- ✅ Removed hardcoded IP address from `backend/config/database.js`
- ✅ Made Cloud SQL detection generic (no specific IP addresses)

### 3. Enhanced .gitignore
- ✅ Added comprehensive .env file patterns
- ✅ Added Excel files (*.xlsx, *.xls) to prevent data exposure
- ✅ Added CSV and SQL files
- ✅ Added temporary file patterns

### 4. Files Safe to Commit
- ✅ All code files are safe (no hardcoded credentials)
- ✅ Documentation files use placeholders only
- ✅ Configuration files use environment variables

## 🔐 Before Pushing to Git

### Verify These Files Are NOT in Git:
```bash
# Check if any sensitive files are tracked
git ls-files | grep -E "\.env$|\.xlsx$|\.xls$|password|secret"
```

### Required .env File (DO NOT COMMIT):
Create `backend/.env` with:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_HOST:5432/YOUR_DB_NAME?sslmode=require
# OR
DB_HOST=YOUR_HOST
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
DB_USER=YOUR_USERNAME
DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD

PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They contain your actual credentials
2. **Never commit Excel files** - They may contain sensitive business data
3. **Always use environment variables** - Never hardcode credentials in code
4. **Review all files** before committing - Check for any exposed secrets

## 📝 Files Modified for Security

1. `backend/ENV_SETUP.md` - Removed actual credentials, added placeholders
2. `backend/config/database.js` - Removed hardcoded IP address
3. `.gitignore` - Enhanced to exclude sensitive files

## ✅ Ready for Git Upload

Your codebase is now safe to upload to Git. All sensitive information has been removed and replaced with placeholders.
